This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(janitor)
library(tigris)
library(lubridate)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.
```{r}
first_games<-read_csv("data/2020-08-19.csv")

second_games<-read_csv("data/2022-01-08.csv")

first_reviews<-read_csv("data/bgg-15m-reviews.csv")

second_reviews<-read_csv("data/bgg-15m-reviews.csv")

game_details<-read_csv("data/games_detailed_info.csv")
```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
