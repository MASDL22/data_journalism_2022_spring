#Most neutral reviews: Catan (28,966)

#Narrative: The game Pandemic seems to have the most positive reviews. Monopoly has the most negative reviews, and Catan has the most neutral reviews. It's ironic that during a pandemic, the board game became the most popular. This statistic insinuates that users were infatuated with the pandemic as much as they were locked down due to the virus. Contrary to presumption, Monopoly - a well-known, popular game - gathered the most negative reviews; however, about 10,000 reviews isn't close to the approximately 60,000 Pandemic gathered. The 10,000 reviews is the least of the top-3.

#Positive bigrams demonstrates how players on the gaming site feel towards certain games. "Board game" had the most bigrams within the reviews which is contradictory to the negative bigrams as we later discovered. We would've thought bigrams like "favorite game", "amazing game" or something similar would've taken the top spot but they weren't even in the top 10 bigrams. There is an assumption that more reviewers seemed to enjoy four player games more than two players games which could mean that many of the games on the site are more suited for four players instead of two. The amount of negative bigrams within negative reviews make some sense based on how players will express their hatred of whatever game they're reviewing. Nearly half of the reviews had "worst game" within them which is the opposite of having someone say a game is the best game there ever was. What was interesting was how the bigram "board game" was present in more reviews than the bigram "card game" "Board game" appears 32% of the bigrams made while "card game" only accounts for 18.2% of the bigrams. We established that Monopoly is the worst rated game in the site, which might account for the majority of the negative reviews that involve board games.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
