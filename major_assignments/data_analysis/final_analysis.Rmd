#Most neutral reviews: Catan (28,966)

#Narrative: The game Pandemic seems to have the most positive reviews. Monopoly has the most negative reviews, and Catan has the most neutral reviews. It's ironic that during a pandemic, the board game became the most popular. This statistic insinuates that users were infatuated with the pandemic as much as they were locked down due to the virus. Contrary to presumption, Monopoly - a well-known, popular game - gathered the most negative reviews; however, about 10,000 reviews isn't close to the approximately 60,000 Pandemic gathered. The 10,000 reviews is the least of the top-3.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
